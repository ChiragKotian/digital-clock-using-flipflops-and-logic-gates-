# Digital Clock Made using Flip-Flops and Logic Gates

In this project, we **_designed_** and **_implemented_** a **24-hour clock** using _7-Segment displays, BCD to 7-Segment ICs, flip-flops and logic gates_. _Arduino Uno R3_ acts as a _1-second clock_ signal generator.

The clock was _designed_ and _simulated_ before implementation on **_Logisim_** software.
